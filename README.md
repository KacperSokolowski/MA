This repository contains the complete code and data used in the study titled:  
<b>"Rental Price Formation in Warsaw: A Hedonic Approach with Feature Interactions and Machine Learning"</b>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

This project applies an XGBoost-based hedonic pricing model to analyze rental listings in Warsaw. The dataset was collected using web-scraping and includes a wide set of features, such as structural apartment attributes, location metrics, and neighborhood characteristics. The project leverages explainable machine learning techniques (SHAP and DALEX) to evaluate variable importance and test hypotheses concerning interactions between features.
